      <p> Taking minutes in a meeting is a very important task that is used to document 
        progression of a group. Meeting are something that is used to get all workers on
        the same page about a project in the workplace. Minutes are useful to backtrack about
        topics that were already mentioned and to track tasks that need to be done or 
        have been completed.
