        <h4>Item 1 for <strong>Review</strong>>:</h4>
        <p>
            Last meeting we went over how to create a better environment for everyone and there has been some progress made on that endeavor. 
            We had a couple of role changes and that has allowed for more people to gain experience in multiple positions breaking up some monotony. However, 
            we will have to watch out for productivity drops due to more mistakes being made, so we will bring up accuracy in work next time.  

        </p>
        <h4>Item 2 for <strong>Review</strong>>:</h4>
        <p>
            Last time a couple of queries were made about possible improvements to office life and after talking to my boss I was able to work out some new benefits 
            for everyone. I am still in the process of of getting the paperwork together and signed by all the official channels but expect new benefits to be announced 
            by next meeting at the latest.

        <p>
            What can we expect from our next project in terms of workload considering our updated roles?
            After observing the new working conditions for my role I would like an update to our tools.
